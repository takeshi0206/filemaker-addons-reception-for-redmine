# Overview

　This add-on provides the ability to collect on-screen information from FileMaker and send data to other services. By arranging buttons in any layout in FileMaker and setting them by default, users can send data to a given destination or service with a few pushes of the button (or called by another script). Users will be able to post information about various FileMaker layouts to a common reception.

　At this point, you may be wondering, "Why don't you build the entire workflow with FileMaker without using other services?", But if you are a user who mainly uses communication tools, you can use the tools you are familiar with. However, the hurdles for introduction will be lower if the business flow is run in the backyard. What used to be an application in Word, Excel, or PDF file will be sent to the reception desk by entering it in the layout of FileMaker and pressing the application button, and the staff will click the link to FileMaker to check the contents. to change.

　The communication tools targeted this time are Redmine, Slack, and eMail (Gmail). I made add-ons for each service. Add-ons act like a hub for FileMaker and communication tools. Depending on how you use it, you can use FileMaker as the front of a communication tool. In the Slack version and the eMail version, the information is in one direction from the applicant to the reception desk, but in the Redmine version, the status of the ticket (issue) can also be confirmed on the FileMaker side. This is just one example, but you can use this add-on as a template and customize it for a variety of services.

　The basic image of this workflow is the general reception and inquiry response process such as various application windows of organizations and groups, inquiry management from users, sales reports, and incident response. This kind of system is no longer rare in Web services, but FileMaker has the advantage that everything works on-premises, so for example, setting up a problem response window at the emergency response headquarters, needs at evacuation centers and opening a problem response window. , It is possible to respond to sudden system introduction requests in closed areas that are not connected to the Internet. You can quickly create a layout form that meets various needs with FileMaker, paste this add-on (reception for Redmine), enter information on the iPad, and the backyard staff will respond to the ticket-driven project management system (Redmine). ) Will be instantly registered, creating an instant reception system.
